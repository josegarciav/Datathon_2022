# Datathon 2022
This repository contains code for my team's submission to the Datathon 2022 competition. Our team won fourth place in the competition, and this repository contains the code we used to develop our solution.

The idea was to implement a classification algorithm to determine which indicated crimes in our dataset were actually false positives. 

## Datathon_Jose
This Jupyter notebook (Datathon_Jose.ipynb) contains the main code for our submission. The notebook includes an overview of the problem we were trying to solve, a description of our approach, and a detailed explanation of our code. We used various data science techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and various machine learning approaches to develop our solution.

## LSTM Datathon_Jose
This Jupyter notebook (LSTM Datathon_Jose.ipynb) contains an alternative solution that we developed using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The notebook includes an explanation of the LSTM architecture, a description of our approach, and a detailed explanation of our code. We experimented with various hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

We are proud of the work we did for this competition and believe that our solution demonstrates the power of data science and machine learning in solving real-world problems. We hope that our code can be useful to others who are interested in similar problems or who want to learn more about data science techniques.

## Data
Some of the geo data we used to develop our solution is included in the Excel files attached above. The geo data was obtained and saved using Google Map's API (Python's library geopy.geocoders).
